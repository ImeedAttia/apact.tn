<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

  
<img  src="src\assets\screen-shot.jpg"  alt="screen shot"  width="80"  height="80">

  


We, Apact Company, create advertising spaces on the back of the gift slips worth twenty dinars, in which the citizen buys Tunisian products only, the bar code is 619 from the left of the large areas, provided that the total value of the purchases is at least one hundred dinars (twenty dinars is a gift and eighty dinars paid by the citizen). . (A sample of the gift slip accompanies this requirement)

This requirement enables the customer to contribute to the payment of a part of the free value of the gift slip by justifying a advertising space out of the ten spaces on the back front of each gift piece, on which the trademark of his company is placed. .

 The gift items are the subject of the agreement concluded between Jawahir Advertising Company and the General Gas Company, as well as the Tunisian Company for Electricity and Gas (the content can be found via the link:.......), which aims mainly to be assigned weekly and free of charge to Jawahir Advertising Company for the company Tunisian Electricity and Gas (STEG) gift kits worth twenty dinars (includes the price, all payments and profits of the General Gas Company, and does not include the benefit to return one of the purchased goods) that it distributes to its members free of charge to supply the products of Tunisian companies only, its bar code (619 from the left ), contained in the back front of the gift piece, from the areas of the General Gas Company, provided that the total value of purchases is at least one hundred dinars (twenty dinars as a gift and eighty dinars paid by the participant), divided equally among all types of products listed on the back of the piece, i.e. the value of At least ten dinars for each company that contributed in paying part of the free value of the fragment.

For the fragments that faced the background consisting of ten advertising spaces (the subject of this requirement), the value of the contribution to your company by justifying one area is two Tunisian dinars, including the performance on the added value, in exchange for at least ten dinars of purchases of your products from the beneficiary of the fragment. The order is per thousand (one space on the backend of each fragment) only.

Please fill in the accompanying instructions card, and once this request is submitted, our department will provide you with an estimated invoice via e-mail for viewing.
